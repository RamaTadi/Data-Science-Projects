The **SQLite Database** used in this EDA is related to  ***Indian Premier League***  of  Cricket with 577 matches, players & teams attributes from **seasons 2008 to 2016.** The database has 22 tables storing data related to measurements of various attributes of the game cricket. 

We will use the ***sqlite3*** library of python to connect to the database and use ***pandas*** to read SQL query or database table into a DataFrame  and get the required results and use the ***seaborn*** and ***matplotlib*** data visualization libraries to visualize the data.
